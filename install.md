# Install or upgrade

mozregression is a Python (currently 2.7) package installable via pip. You can
follow the OS-specific instructions to install pip if you don't know how to do it:

- **Windows**:
  Download and install python 2.7 from
  [ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads).
  It will include pip and set python in your PATH.
- **Mac**:

      sudo easy_install pip

- **Ubuntu**:

      sudo apt-get install python-pip

Once you have pip installed along with python 2.7, just open a terminal
